# CS201-tidycensus-collab

This repository is used as an exercise in github collaboration in its most basic form!

We'll use tidycensus_intro.Rmd as starting point for our collaborative activity. (Thanks to Connor & Dr. Brockway!)

For collaboration:

1. Find a partner.
2. Decide who will be the "Owner" and who will be the "Collaborator."
3. The Owner will fork this repository and then invite the Collaborator.
4. The Owner will create a new project in R Studio associated with this repository. How do things look? Commit & Push!
5. Now the Collaborator will create a new project in R Studio.
6. Both O & C open tidycensus_intro.Rmd. Save a copy with "-yourname."
7. Save, commit, and push!
8. Pull! Did you get a copy of your partner's file?

Owner: Mehana Leafchild

Collaborator: Alexandrea Cole
